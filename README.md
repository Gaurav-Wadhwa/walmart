# Retail Store (Walmart) Inventory Management Analysis

## Problem Statement:

A retail store chain with multiple outlets is encountering challenges in managing inventory to align with the demand and supply across the country. The provided dataset, `walmart.csv`, contains information about weekly sales for various stores, including features such as store number, date, weekly sales, holiday flags, temperature, fuel price, consumer price index (CPI), and unemployment rate.

## Objectives:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Analysis:

a. **Impact of Unemployment Rate on Weekly Sales:**
   - Analyze if weekly sales are affected by the unemployment rate.
   - Identify stores that are most affected by changes in the unemployment rate.

b. **Seasonal Trends in Weekly Sales:**
   - Investigate if weekly sales exhibit a seasonal trend.
   - Identify the specific times of the year when the sales show fluctuations.

c. **Effect of Temperature on Weekly Sales:**
   - Explore the relationship between temperature and weekly sales.

d. **Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Weekly Sales:**
   - Analyze how the Consumer Price Index influences the weekly sales of various stores.

e. **Top Performing Stores:**
   - Identify top-performing stores based on historical data.

f. **Worst Performing Store and Performance Gap:**
   - Identify the worst-performing store.
   - Assess the significance of the difference between the highest and lowest performing stores.

### 2. Predictive Modeling:

Use predictive modeling techniques to forecast sales for each store for the next 12 weeks.

## Approach:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Perform outlier analysis.

2. **Statistical Analysis and EDA:**
   - Conduct descriptive statistics.
   - Visualize relationships between variables.
   - Explore correlations.

3. **Unemployment Rate Analysis:**
   - Analyze the correlation between unemployment rate and weekly sales.
   - Identify stores with the strongest correlation.

4. **Seasonal Trends and Temperature Impact:**
   - Use time-series analysis to identify seasonal patterns in weekly sales.
   - Explore the impact of temperature on sales.

5. **Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis:**
   - Analyze the correlation between CPI and weekly sales.
   - Understand the influence of CPI on different stores.

6. **Store Performance Analysis:**
   - Identify top-performing and worst-performing stores.
   - Assess the performance gap.

7. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Choose appropriate forecasting models (e.g., time-series forecasting).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train models and evaluate their performance.

8. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Summarize key insights.
   - Provide recommendations for inventory management strategies based on the analysis.

## Deliverables:

- Detailed analysis report documenting findings, insights, and recommendations.
- Visualizations and plots supporting the analysis.
- Predictive models for sales forecasting.
- Codebase for data analysis and modeling.

This analysis aims to provide actionable insights that will help the retail store chain optimize inventory management and make informed decisions to meet demand effectively.
